Each project is **simple**, **beginner-friendly**, and uses **one clear Web API**.

---

# ✅ **1. Soundboard App**

### 🎧 **Web API Used:** Audio API (`new Audio()`)

---

## 📌 **Problem Statement**

Create a webpage with multiple buttons. Each button plays a unique sound (like a drum pad or fun effects). Users can click to produce sounds instantly.

---

## 🎯 **Motivation**

It teaches how to load audio files and trigger them with user actions — the easiest possible use of a Web API.

---

## ⭐ **Core Features**

* A grid of buttons
* Each button plays a different audio
* A volume slider
* Mute/unmute toggle
* Add-your-own-sound via file input (optional)

---

## 🔧 **Flow**

1. Page loads → Sound buttons appear.
2. User clicks "Laugh" button → plays laugh.mp3.
3. User adjusts volume slider → updates global volume.
4. Mute toggle → sets audio volume to 0.
5. User uploads an MP3 → new button is added that plays it.

---

## 💾 **Data Model** (simple array)

```js
[
  { label: "Clap", file: "clap.mp3" },
  { label: "Laugh", file: "laugh.mp3" }
]
```

---

## 📂 **Folder Structure**

```
soundboard/
  index.html
  style.css
  script.js
  sounds/
    clap.mp3

---

## 🔧 **Flow**

1. User types “Hello world”.
2. Click "Copy" → now the text is inside clipboard.
3. User clicks "Paste" → textarea gets clipboard content.
4. Copied items list appears below.

---

## 💾 **Data Model**

```js
{
  history: ["Hello world", "Some text"]
}
```

---

## 📂 **Folder Structure**

```
clipboard-helper/
  index.html
  style.css
  script.js
```

---

## 💾 **Data Model**

```js
[
  { id: 1, text: "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." }
]
```

---
